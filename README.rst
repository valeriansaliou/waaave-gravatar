`waaave-gravatar` makes it easy to add Gravatar support to your Django
application through the addition of a template tag.

History
*******

This code was taken from http://django-gravatar.googlecode.com, but it
was superseded by the https://github.com/ericflo/django-avatar package,
which provides a way more general approach to avatars in Django (not
Gravatar-specific, with local Django caching).

If, however, you want to stick to a Gravatar-only solution, this package
may a bit more "lightweight" and easier to start using.
